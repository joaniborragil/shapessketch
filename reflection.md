Throughout the process of making my sketch, I found various things challenging, one of them, in particular, was how to include variables into my code such as X, Y, W, and H with numbers and having to X, -, / and *  them. Including such coordinates and variables in my drawings was also a hassle as I truly had no clue until I began experimenting on P5js.org. An example of when I found it challenging to include variables into my code is when I had to make the right window in my sketch, it was difficult for me to come up with a pattern to code the windows and implement regular integers with variables, it took me various tries. Fortunately, throughout the process of coding my sketch, particularly the function I created the function myShape I began noticing a pattern in how the variables and the shape itself function (how it translates to the drawing), I went from taking 30 minutes to code Windows to only taking about 10 minutes to get the "gist" of which variables and numbers I need to code the Door in my sketch. My sketch is particularly what I am most proud of as a whole, it sounds odd, but I am not the most artistic person, and for my drawing to look like something I intended, is something I am extremely proud of. In addition, I am also proud of being able to implement the variables and understand what each means and does in my code.

P1: Colors are changed in Sketch, due to them contrasting oddly, and the roof moves with Y mouse instead of its strict coordinates. Coordinate implementation was difficult.

P2: Similar to the final Sketch, the lines in the Sketch are more neat and straight. Colors are exact to Sketch.
